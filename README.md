# Challenge-14---Belly-Button

##  Belly Button Biodiversity dataset

_The goal of this challenge was to use knowledge of JavaScript visualizations to make a special dashboard. This dashboard helps people explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset keeps track of tiny living things (microbes) that live in the human belly button._

_What's interesting is that a small group of these living things, known as operational taxonomical units (OTUs), were found in over 70% of the people. The others were not as common. Our aim is to let users check this out on their own using the interactive dashboard._

## Instructions

1- Use the D3 library to read in samples.json
2- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
6- Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
